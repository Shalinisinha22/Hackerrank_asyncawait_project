# Hackerrank_asyncawait_project
Hello Everyone, 
Project Name: HackerRank Automation 
In this project I'm using puppeteer library of NodeJs and async await function of Javascript.

This Code runs in such a way that it will first open the Chromium Browser then automatically login in the 𝐇𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐖𝐞𝐛𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞
After that : 
1)Auto login
2)Select the topic (Automatically )
3)Choose the difficulty level 
4)Start Solving Question one by one automatically.
